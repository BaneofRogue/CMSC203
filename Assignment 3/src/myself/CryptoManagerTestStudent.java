 *  Class: CMSC203 CRN 31338
 Program: Assignment #3
 Instructor: Ashique Tanveer
 Summary of Description: This program is designed to test the CryptoManager class and its methods. The methods are isStringInBounds, caesarEncryption, bellasoEncryption, caesarDecryption, and bellasoDecryption. The test cases are designed to test the methods with different inputs and outputs.
 Due Date: 03/21/2025
 Integrity Pledge: I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently.
 I have not copied the code from a student or any source.
Student: William Keller
